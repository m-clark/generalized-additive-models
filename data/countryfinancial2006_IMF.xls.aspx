Reported NGDP series are production-based, while NGDP_R series are estimated using expenditure based nominal GDP in the base year and contributions to growth in subsequent years.

DANE (Colombia Institute of Statistics) has done a rebasing of the national accounts (now base year is 2005 and before 2000). Data with the new base is ONLY AVAILABLE FROM 2000. The change also includes methodological changes (for example, direct estimation of private consumption based on a survey) and most important, change in the index formulae (historically a Laspeyres fixed-base index and now a Laspeyres chain index). The main implications are that the 2000 and 2005 series are not comparable and the chain index is associated with non-additivity of the components.

India	Gross domestic product, constant prices	National currency	Billions	Source: IMF Staff. The original data is in calendar years from 1997. Prior to 1997, IMF staff converted fiscal-year data to calendar years by taking 3/4 data of  year t and 1/4 data of year t+1 as data for calendar year t. Moreover, since quarterly data do not add up to the annual data adjustments are made to the quarterly data, hence they differ slightly from the official figures. Latest actual data: 2011. Official data for the latest year are advanced estimates. Data available on quarter-by-quarter basis.

Kuwait	Gross domestic product, constant prices	National currency	Billions	Source: Ministry of Planning and Central Statistical Office Latest actual data: 2010. The latest year of  data for national accounts at constant prices is 2007. Notes: Real GDP data for the period 1990-1999 have been adjusted by desk economist to account for breaks in the source data. The breaks are associated with changes in the base year from 1984 to 1995 and subsequently to 2000. Only pre-revision data exist for the period prior to 1995. Simple rebasing technique does not apply because even the nominal data were revised back to 1995. Using the pre-revision data, desk economist recalculated the constant price data for the period prior to 1995 so that y-o-y change of each component remains unchanged. A similar adjustment was made to the period 1995-1999.
